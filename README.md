algorithms for everyday coding problems

Problem 1. For a given finite integer sequence, find the largest consecutive sum of the elements in the given sequence with time complexity O(n).

Let's start with sorting.
1. selection sort
   - find the max or min in each subsequence and put them in decreasing/increasing order
   - each subsequence is generated by deleting the max or min value from the previous subsequence
   - for example, for previous subsequence {4,1,5,3,9} min of the sequence is 1 so put 1 in the first position
     and delete 1 from the subsequence {4,1,5,3,9} which results to {4,5,3,9}. Then repeat the same procedure till the end.
